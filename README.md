### What I learned

#### Lesson #1

Always start with HTML and CSS. Never go directly to Styled Components, at least not for bigger projects. Small component styling is ok though.

#### Lesson #2

Before jumping into the project, decide carefully about the best layout tool, because a bad decision can lead to a huge amount of extra work to refactor the CSS code and even the HTML/JSX.
Look at how components are behaving in the different views, and decide how to best scale the content (or not), between the fixed views (based on the Figma design). I spent a lot of time scaling the images, but they looked so ugly (web optimized), that I finally decided to fix their sizes to the given image size. As this is not defined in the challenge docs, I guess it's ok.

### Continued development

Further refactoring and simplification is needed, because the component styling became to complex, and full of redundant, or unnecessary code, that I didn't want to waste time to do.
