			<h4>The terminology...</h4>
			<h3>Space capsule</h3>
			<p>
				A space capsule is an often-crewed spacecraft that uses a blunt-body reentry capsule to reenter the
				Earth's atmosphere without wings. Our capsule is where you'll spend your time during the flight. It
				includes a space gym, cinema, and plenty of other activities to keep you entertained.
