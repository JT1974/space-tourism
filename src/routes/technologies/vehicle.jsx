			<h4>The terminology...</h4>
			<h3>Launch vehicle</h3>
			<p>
				A launch vehicle or carrier rocket is a rocket-propelled vehicle used to carry a payload from Earth's
				surface to space, usually to Earth orbit or beyond. Our WEB-X carrier rocket is the most powerful in
				operation. Standing 150 metres tall, it's quite an awe-inspiring sight on the launch pad!
