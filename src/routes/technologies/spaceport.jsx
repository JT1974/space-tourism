			<h4>The terminology...</h4>
			<h3>Spaceport</h3>
			<p>
				A spaceport or cosmodrome is a site for launching (or receiving) spacecraft, by analogy to the seaport
				for ships or airport for aircraft. Based in the famous Cape Canaveral, our spaceport is ideally situated
				to take advantage of the Earthâ€™s rotation for launch.
